<!-- In this program, we use the 'fetch' method to make a request to the API endpoint, and then use the 'then' method to handle the response.
We first check if the response object has an 'ok' property, which indicates whether the response was successful or not. If the response was not successful, we throw an error with a descriptive message.
If the response was successful, we parse the response body as JSON using 'response.json()', and then log the resulting data to the console using console.log(data).
If there is an error during the request, we catch the error using the 'catch' method and log it to the console using console.error(error). -->
